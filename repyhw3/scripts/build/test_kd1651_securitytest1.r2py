#This test case tries simple brute attack by tryig to write 'MZ' at offset 0. Sinple case.
#If security monitor fails to stop, it writes and prints Security Bug...

# Open a file
myfile=openfile("look.txt", True)
 
# Attempt to write "MZ" to the file
try:
  myfile.writeat("MZ", 0)
 
# It raised an Exception (as it was supposed to):
except ValueError:
  pass #no output if there is no bug
 
# No Exception was raised
else:
  log("Security Bug. Wrote MZ at offset 0")
 
finally:
  # Close the file after our attempt.
