# This testcase checks whether the security layer blocks MZ from the 0th location only or from first location also.
# Open a file
myfile=openfile("look.txt", True)
 
# Attempt to write "MZ" to the file
try:
  # Avoiding SeekPastEndOfFileError (since EOF is at 
  # offset 0 in a newly created file)
  myfile.writeat("Z", 0)
  myfile.writeat("MZ", 1)
  
 
# It raised an Exception :
except ValueError:
  log("The security layer blocked a valid write!!!")

# What if it raised something other than ValueError?
 
# No Exception was raised (as it wasn't supposed to)
else:
  pass
 
finally:
  # Close the file after our attempt.
  myfile.close()
