# This testcase checks if the security layer blocks a valid write, which is- 'MY'; and also if it blocks 'M' at the 0th location.
# Open a file
myfile=openfile("look.txt", True)
 
# Attempt to write "MY" to the file
try:
  myfile.writeat("MY", 0)
 
# It raised an Exception (as it was supposed to):
except ValueError:
  log("The security layer blocked a valid write!!!")

# What if it raised something other than ValueError?
 
# No Exception was raised (as it wasn't supposed to)
else:
  pass
 
finally:
  # Close the file after our attempt.
  myfile.close()
