# This test case checks whether the securitylayer can block writing MZ, when the attacker uses two separate writeat functions.
# Open a file
myfile=openfile("look.txt", True)
 
# Attempt to write "MZ" to the file
try:
  myfile.writeat("M", 0)
  myfile.writeat("Z", 1)
 
# It raised an Exception (as it was supposed to):
except ValueError:
  pass #no output if there is no bug
 
# No Exception was raised
else:
  log("Wrote an MZ successfully!!!")
 
finally:
  # Close the file after our attempt.
  myfile.close()
